## My process

- I started by analyzing the original design and planning my approach.
- I created the basic HTML structure and gave classes to the elements.
- I coded general styles.
- I coded the mobile design.
- I adjusted the max width of a few elements to make it look good in dekstop.
- I styled the active, hover and focus states.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about the pseudo classes avtive, hover and focus. I knew they existed but I had never used them before. I'll incorporate this knowledge for future projects.
